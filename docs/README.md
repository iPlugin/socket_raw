Hi everyone, I get the test â„–3:

[ Client/Server application to search files on remote HOST ]

Implement Packets checker application.
- Create simple TCP based client-server applications.
- Create a proxy application (that is in the middle).
- Application logic:
	- Client sends data to Proxy. 
	- Option1: Proxy just forwards it to the server.
	- Option2: Proxy does modifications in payload and resend them to server.

For Option2: Server must figure out that data has been changed in the middle (calculating packet checksum).
